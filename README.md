# Bookmarklets!

This is a little repo for my bookmarklet projects. Right now the only thing worth noting
is my [Github pixel drawing bookmarklet](https://github.com/AndresCuervo/bookmarklet-collection/blob/master/gh-color-commit-log/script.js)
that turns any Github commit calendar into a simple little pixel editor with a few colors!
